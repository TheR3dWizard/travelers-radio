# Travelers Radio

This is a project to create a website where people can upload their covers of the song Travelers from Outer Wilds and listen to a radio playing them. The song is a beautiful piece of music from the game Outer Wilds, composed by Andrew Prahlow that in my opinion is a symbol against loneliness and I hope that this project can bring people together
